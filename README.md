Library People learning code #YVR
===============================

This is a repository to provide a space for members of a local learn code group in Vancouver (YVR).

Based on the use of github by the code4lib community we are experimenting with github to support our learning needs as follows:

## About this repository

* Post a project idea
* Create a discussion item
* Reveal your code and your repository
* Work on a software project together
* Fork a project on github
* Record meeting notes and other ideas in the wiki


## About this group

We are a group of local library people around Vancouver with a commitment to work on coding skills together. We do a weekly create and transparently show our learning to peers and mentors in the group.  Everyone in the group is a peer AND a mentor.  We have no members by virtue of any group or employer affliliation.

To join you will have to:
* get your own github account
* share ideas, tools and talk
